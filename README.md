# Flashcard-Challenge OSU Winter Hackathon Project
Flashcard Challenge was initially created during the [OSU Club's Winter 2018 Hackathon event](https://sites.google.com/oregonstate.edu/osuhackathonclub).
It is an application that allows users to sign in and challenge another user to a round of flashcards.
There are 4 decks to choose from: Biology, Physics, American History, and Computer Science.
The player chooses a deck and then will be matched with someone. Once a match is made, they can start the game.
Socket.io is used for player interactions. Once a game is started, progress bars show how many answers the other player
has gotten correct. The first player to 100% wins the game.
